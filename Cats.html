    <h1>Cats</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small <a href="#nowhere">carnivorous</a> mammal.[1][2] It is the
        only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it
        from the wild members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter
        ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their
        ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]

        The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp
        teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well
        developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and
        grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular),
        the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for
        human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7] Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.[8]

        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to
        five kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat
        fancy. Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the
        abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of
        entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.[10]

    <h2>Etymology and naming</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was
        first used at the beginning of the 6th century.[20] It was suggested that the word 'cattus' is derived from an
        Egyptian precursor of Coptic ϣⲁⲩ šau, "tomcat", or its feminine form suffixed with -t.[21] The Late Latin word
        may be derived from another Afro-Asiatic[22] or Nilo-Saharan language. The Nubian word kaddîska "wildcat" and
        Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.[23] The Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic.. It is "equally
        likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic word, imported into Latin and
        thence to Greek and to Syriac and Arabic".[24] The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European
        languages, and ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sami gáđfi, "female stoat", and Hungarian hölgy,
        "lady, female stoat"; from Proto-Uralic *käďwä, "female (of a furred animal)".[25]

    <h2>Evolution</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Domestication</h3>
    <p>
        The earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was excavated close by a human
        Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500–7200 BC. Since there is no evidence of
        native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat and
        other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland.[46] Scientists therefore assume that African
        wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by rodents, in particular the house
        mouse (Mus musculus), and were tamed by Neolithic farmers. This commensal relationship between early farmers and
        tamed cats lasted thousands of years. As agricultural practices spread, so did tame and domesticated
        cats.[11][6] Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time.[47]

    <h3>Skull</h3>
    <p>The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw.[62]: 35 
        Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. When it overpowers its prey, a cat
        delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them between two of the prey's vertebrae
        and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death.[63] Compared to other felines, domestic
        cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their
        preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae.[63] The premolar and first molar together compose
        the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of
        scissors. These are vital in feeding, since cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are
        largely incapable of mastication.[62]: 37  Although cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay
        generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of
        food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar, they are nonetheless subject to occasional
        tooth loss and infection.</p>
